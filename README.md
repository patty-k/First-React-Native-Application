# First-React-Native-Application
With the help of JavaScript Mastery on youtube, I created my first mobile app with React Native. I first learned the basics of React through creating a simple todolist website before jumping into this as React is one of the most valuable skills to have. About 75% of knowledge from making websites can translate to building mobile applications.

In the video, I came to understand many React Native terms that are similar to html. For example, **text** in react native - **p and h tags** in react, **View** in react native - **div** in html.

Through this 2 hour and 15 minute tutorial I learned:
- develop visually appealing UI/UX designs
- fetch data from an external API and integrate it
- implement search & pagination functionality
- create customAPI data fetching hooks
- write clean, organized, and maintainable code with proper architecture
- follow the best practices for React Native development

I also learned about various react native components in depth such as: Activity Indicator, Flatlists, TouchableOpacitiy, ScrollView, SafeAreaView, and many more.
